Welcome to my main repository under green-fox-academy!

My name's Adam and I am a proud member of the Megalotis Cohort's 
Astral team. [Click here to reach my team's -Astral- GitHub 
syllabus](https://github.com/green-fox-academy/astral-syllabus)

You may also find my learning projects and workshop materials 
here, 
spiced with some Star Wars geekishness.
